""" 
You have three buckets:
- Bucket A, 8 litres
- Bucket B, 5 litres
- Bucket C, 3 litres
Bucket A is full, while buckets B and C are empty. As result, you need to have 4 litres in bucket
A and 4 litres in bucket B by emptying or filling entirely with each other.
Implement an algorithm in C/C++ that finds a solution to the problem and display as output the
sequence of pourings identified by the algorithm itself.
Please note:
The buckets have no scale, so it is not possible to pour a precise amount of water (es: a pouring
of 1 litre).
A given pouring:
- Will completely empty the starting bucket if the destination bucket has enough capacity
left
- Will partially empty the starting bucket (until the destination bucket is full), if the
destination bucket doesnâ€™t have enough capacity to accept the entire content of the
starting bucket
